SINGAPORE: Gas tariffs for households will rise by 1.6 per cent or 0.30 cent per kilowatt hour (kWh) from Jul 1 to Sep 30, City Gas said on Saturday (Jun 29).
This means that households will need to pay 19.10 cents per kWh, excluding Goods and Services Tax, up from 18.80 cents currently.
The increase is due to higher fuel costs compared with the previous quarter, City Gas said.
City Gas reviews the gas tariffs based on guidelines set by the Energy Market Authority, which has approved the gas tariffs for the three-month period. 
SP Group also said on Saturday that electricity tariffs will increase from Jul 1 to Sep 30 by 6.4 per cent, or 1.43 cents per kWh. 
The increase is mainly due to the higher cost of natural gas for electricity generation, it said.
