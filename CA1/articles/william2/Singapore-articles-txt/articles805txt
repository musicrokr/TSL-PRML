SINGAPORE: A war relic was found on Tuesday (Jul 23) at a construction site at 60 Geylang Lorong 23, near Aljunied MRT station. 
What is thought to be a World War II bomb was discovered by an excavator operator at about 9.30am, said Mr Subari, safety officer of Trust Build Engineering & Construction. 
Mr Subari told CNA that the Singapore Armed Forces' Explosive Ordnance Disposal team has determined that the war relic is not live. 
Contractors have been instructed to engage a licensed third-party contractor to remove the relic, he added.
A secure site for its detonation had to be found before it can be removed, Mr Subari said.
Mr Subari said that the suspected explosive was removed at around 6pm by Explomo Technical Services Pte Ltd, which is certified by the Defence Ministry to dispose of ordnance.
An eyewitness who did not want to be named told CNA that he saw parts of the area cordoned off when he was there around 1.15pm.
"They had cordoned off the Opp (sic) Aljuned Station bus stop and the walkways under the MRT tracks," he said. "The only thing the police mentioned is that one of the buildings, the Work+Store building, had been evacuated."
"An aunty was saying she needed to walk through the walkway to a building, then the officer pointed and said, 'This building?'"
The police officer said the building had been evacuated, he added.
CNA has contacted the Ministry of Defence for more information.
