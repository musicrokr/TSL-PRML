SCDF said it was alerted to the incident at Block 224 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 at about 3.05pm. The fire, which had erupted from a flat on the fourth floor of the Housing Board block, was raging when firefighters arrived. 
"Upon SCDF's arrival, the fire was raging and involved the contents of the entire unit. The fire was extinguished with one water jet," SCDF said in a Facebook post. 
Ms Nuraidah Mustafa, a resident of the area, told CNA she could smell the scent of burning plastic from her flat despite living a few blocks away. 
Two SCDF fire engines were at the scene to tackle the blaze, which was emitting plumes of black smoke, she added.
