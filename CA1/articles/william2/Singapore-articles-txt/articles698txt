The licence of Kate’s Catering was suspended on Mar 26 and the suspension was 
 on May 17 after the caterer rectified the lapses and put in proper measures to enhance their food preparation processes, SFA said.
The new food hygiene grade for Kate’s Catering will be reviewed in 12 months.
SFA said that it will also continue to keep the premises of Kate’s Catering under surveillance.
“Food operators are reminded to adhere to good food hygiene and safety processes. Infection prevention practices such as the washing of hands before handling food can greatly reduce the incidence of gastroenteritis when adopted by all key stakeholders, including the industry and public,” SFA added.
