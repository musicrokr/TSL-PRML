REUTERS: Southampton are poised to announce the season-long loan signing of Augsburg defender Kevin Danso on Friday after making a late bid for the Austria international on the last day of the Premier League transfer window, local media reported.
The Southern Daily Echo reported https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/17825642.southampton-sign-kevin-danso-loan-fc-augsburg-deadline-day that Southampton submitted a deal sheet to the Premier League on Thursday seeking a two-hour extension to the 1600 GMT (05:00 p.m. BST) transfer deadline to get the deal over the line.
The move was held up by Augsburg awaiting an all-clear from the German FA before announcing the 20-year-old's departure, but Southampton are confident all the relevant paperwork was completed in time, the report said.
The Premier League club also have the option to make the move permanent when the loan ends.
Danso, who plays at centre back, trained at the Milton Keynes Dons academy before joining Augsburg in 2014 and made his senior debut for the Bundesliga club at the age of 18.
He made his senior international debut in 2017 and has earned six caps for Austria.
Southampton sold striker Charlie Austin to West Bromwich Albion and loaned midfielder Harrison Reed to Fulham on Thursday as well as extended the contract of winger Nathan Redmond, their player of the season during the last campaign.
