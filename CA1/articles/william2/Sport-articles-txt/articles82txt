LIMA: Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce broke the 40-year-old Pan Am Games 200 metres record when the twice Olympic 100 metres champion clocked 22.43 seconds to win gold on Friday.
The 32-year-old clipped two-hundredths of a second off American Evelyn Ashford's Games record of 22.45 set at San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1979.
Fraser-Pryce, who won Olympic titles in 2008 and 2012, beat Brazil's Vitoria Cristina Rose by almost two-tenths of a second with Bahamian Tynia Gaither third in 22.76.
Her Jamaican compatriot Danniel Thomas-Dodd smashed another Games record in the women's shot put, throwing a national record 19.55 metres.
That erased Cuban Maria Elena Sarria's 1983 record of 19.34 metres.
South American record holder Alex Quinonez of Ecuador won the men's 200 in 20.27 for an easy victory over Jereem Richards of Trinidad & Tobago (20.38) and Yancarlos Martinez of the Dominican Republic (20.44).
Brazil proved to be the fastest in the 4x100 metres relays, winning the women's race 43.04 seconds and the men's in 38.27.
The Brazilians also claimed the men's 10,000 metres with Ederson Vilela running 28 minutes, 27.47 seconds.
The United States, which has found golds scarce in athletics, won two on the sport's penultimate day at the Games.
U.S. record holder Kara Winger prevailed in the javelin with a throw of 64.92 metres and Nikki Hiltz took the women's 1,500 metres in 4:07.14.
