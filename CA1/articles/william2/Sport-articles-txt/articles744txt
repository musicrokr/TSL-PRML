REUTERS: Alex de Minaur was again near-perfect on serve in claiming his second ATP title with a 6-3 7-6(2) win over American Taylor Fritz at the Atlanta Open on Sunday.
De Minaur, 20, went the entire tournament without facing a break point, and the Australian fittingly clinched victory with a deft serve-and-volley backhand winner.
It is the second title for third seed De Minaur, who won the Sydney International in January before being set back by a groin injury.
He lost in the second round at both the French Open and Wimbledon, the latter in a tough five-setter against American Steve Johnson.
De Minaur arrived in Atlanta ranked 34th in the world.
"It's so good to see him back playing good tennis after struggling with injuries," said a magnanimous Taylor, who made 20 unforced errors in the final.
