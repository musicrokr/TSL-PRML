RIO DE JANEIRO: Botafogo came from behind to beat Athletico Paranaense 2-1 and move up to seventh place in Serie A on Sunday after another VAR-influenced match in Brazil's top flight.
Thonny Anderson gave Athletico the lead after 16 minutes when he side-footed home from a tight angle between the keeper and the post.
However, Luiz Fernando equalised 15 minutes later following a poor punch out and Diego Souza gave the home side their second consecutive victory when he scored from the penalty spot 13 minutes from time.
The penalty came after consultation with the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), while an earlier Botafogo goal was ruled out upon reference to the technology.
The win left Botafogo 10 points behind leaders Santos, who lost 3-2 against Sao Paulo on Saturday. Athletico sit four spots and three points behind them.
