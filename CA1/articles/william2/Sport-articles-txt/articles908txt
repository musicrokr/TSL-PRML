LONDON: Hur Mi-jung notched six birdies in the final 10 holes en route to an emphatic four-stroke victory in saturated conditions at the Ladies Scottish Open on Sunday (Aug 11).
The 29-year-old South Korean seized control with four successive birdies from the ninth hole at the Renaissance Club in North Berwick, the same course that hosted the men's Scottish Open last month.
Hur capped off the performance in style with further birdies at the 16th and 18th holes for a five-under-par 66 on a day when club workers were kept busy squeegeeing the greens to keep the course playable in relentless rain.
She was doused with a bottle of champagne by her husband after finishing at 20-under 264 for her third LPGA victory, maintaining her record of winning once every five years, following previous successes in 2009 and 2014.
Overnight leader Moriya Jutanugarn (71) and US Women's Open champion Lee Jeong-eun (70) tied for second place on 16-under.
Lee has a '6' added to her surname to differentiate herself from five other Korean professionals with the same name.
The tournament ended a three-week LPGA stretch in Europe.
