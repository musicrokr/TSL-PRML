REUTERS: Everton have signed 19-year-old striker Moise Kean from Italian champions Juventus on a five-year deal, the Premier League club said on Sunday.
Financial details of the deal were not disclosed but British media reported the transfer fee for the Italy international was about 36 million pounds.
"I am very proud and honoured to wear the Everton shirt. I will give my best to this team," Kean said in a statement.
"I was convinced to sign because Everton is a club looking to the future and so am I. I know about the size of the club, it has big ambition and I will work very hard to help us fulfil what we want to achieve."
Kean, who made his debut for Juventus at the age of 16, scored six goals in Serie A last season as the Turin club won their eighth consecutive league title. He has also scored twice for Italy in three appearances since making his debut last year.
"A striker was one of our priority signings this summer," Everton boss Marco Silva said. "Moise is strong, fast, with many good qualities as a striker and he is just 19 years old.
"He has talent and he is ready to work, ready to improve our squad and gives us different solutions."
Kean became the Merseyside club's fifth recruit of the close season after midfielders Andre Gomes, Fabian Delph, Jean-Philippe Gbamin and goalkeeper Jonas Lossl.
Everton, who finished eighth last season, begin their campaign at Crystal Palace on Saturday.
