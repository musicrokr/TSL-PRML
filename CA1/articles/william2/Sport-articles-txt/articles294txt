PORTO ALEGRE: David Braz scored a late equaliser to give Gremio a point at home to Palmeiras on Saturday and extend to six games the winless league run by the Brazilian Serie A champions.
Striker Dudu put Palmeiras ahead after 14 minutes when he finished off a nice counter attack with a curling left-foot shot.
But defender Braz scored with a long-range effort in the dying moments to give the home side a deserved share of the points.
The win leaves Palmeiras on 30 points, two behind leaders Santos, who have a game in hand away at Cruzeiro on Sunday. Gremio are 12th, with 18 points.
