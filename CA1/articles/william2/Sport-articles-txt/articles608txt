SYDNEY: Australia held off a late fightback from Argentina to secure a 16-10 victory in a scrappy Rugby Championship contest in Brisbane on Saturday.
Winger Reece Hodge scored Australia's only try in the first half but Pumas number eight Facundo Isa crashed over with six minutes on the clock to set up a tense finish.
The home defence held firm, however, to secure the Wallabies only a fourth victory in their last 14 tests and extend Argentina's losing streak in internationals to seven matches.
With New Zealand and South Africa having drawn 16-16 earlier on Saturday, the Wallabies could now win the Rugby Championship for the first time since 2015 if they can beat the All Blacks in their final match of the tournament.
