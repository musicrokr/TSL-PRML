LIMA: The United States collected the first gold medal of the Pan Am Games on Saturday, with Alex Lee spoiling what would have been a dream start for the Peruvian hosts when he beat Hugo Del Castillo in taekwondo's men's poomsae final.
However, Peru did not have to wait long to celebrate their first success when just over an hour later Gladys Tejeda claimed a rousing but controversial win in the women's marathon.
While huge crowds lined the Lima streets to cheer on Tejeda, others were far less enthused with the result by the Peruvian marathoner who was the winner at the 2015 Toronto Pan Am Games but was stripped of her title after a positive drug test.
None of that mattered, however, for the thousands of flag-waving supporters who lined the route as Tejeda powered home in a Games record time of two hours, 30 minutes and 55 seconds, ahead of fading American Bethany Sachtleben and Colombian Anjie Orjuela Soche.
Tejeda's victory offered quick retribution for a near miss by Peru on the taekwondo mats.
Lee, a 20-year-old university student competing in his first Pan Am Games, scored 7.660 to take top spot on the podium over Castillo, who collected a mark of 7.490.
Canada's Abbas Assadian and Mexico's Marco Arroyo shared the bronze.
The marathon and taekwondo competitions marked the start of a busy Day One at the Games with medals also to be awarded in triathlon, weightlifting, canoe, shooting, squash and modern pentathlon.
