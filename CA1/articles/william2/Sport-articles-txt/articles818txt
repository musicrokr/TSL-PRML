The 14 winners will join the continent's top-ranked 26 sides, who have been exempted from the initial round of qualifiers, in the next draw to be held on a date still to be decided.
Those 40 teams will then be split into 10 groups of four for the second qualifying round.
The 10 winners of those groups will then be drawn against each other in home-and-away fixtures, with the five victors advancing to Qatar 2022.
All Africa's 54 member countries are entered.
