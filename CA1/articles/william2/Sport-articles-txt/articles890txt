REUTERS: Trabzonspor's hopes of overturning the outcome of the 2010-11 Turkish Super League, in which they finished runners-up to scandal-hit Fenerbahce, appear to be over after their appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
A long-standing dispute between the clubs began when three officials from Fenerbahce, including the president, were implicated in a match-fixing scandal in the 2010-11 season.
The Turkish Football Federation subsequently sanctioned the three officials in May 2012, but did not punish the club.
Club President Aziz Yildirim, who denied the charges, was sentenced to six years in prison but was acquitted along with 35 other defendants on appeal in 2015 having spent a year in jail.
Trabzonspor has regularly petitioned world governing body FIFA and its legal bodies requesting that it intervene in accordance with the FIFA Disciplinary Code and strip Fenerbahce of the 2010-11 title and award it to them.
FIFA said it's Disciplinary Committee (DC) "was not in a position to intervene" and that Trabzonspor did not fulfil the requirements to lodge an appeal before its Appeal Committee (AC) because it had not been a party to the original proceedings between the TFF and Fenerbahce.
Trabzonspor lodged an appeal to CAS in May 2018 which was heard in March this year.
A CAS statement on Tuesday said: "Having considered the evidence, the CAS Panel found that Trabzonspor did not have standing to sue in front of the FIFA DC and, consequently, it did not have standing to appeal in front of the FIFA AC.
"The CAS Panel recognised the sense of grievance on the part of Trabzonspor but noted that it was limited, in the exercise of its jurisdiction in this particular case, to apply the rules as they have been adopted by the TFF and FIFA."
