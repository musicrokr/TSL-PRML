POTO ALEGRE: Corinthians and Internacional drew 0-0 in a disappointing match in Porto Alegre on Sunday, a result that did little for clubs with title ambitions.
There were only two shots on target the entire game as neither side managed to impose themselves and take control.
The draw, which extended Corinthians' unbeaten league run to five games, left the visitors in sixth place in Serie A with 24 points.
Inter remain one place and three points behind them.
Santos lead the league with 32 points, four ahead of reigning champions Palmeiras, who have a game in hand against Bahia later on Sunday.
