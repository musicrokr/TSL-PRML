LONDON: Renault's German Grand Prix weekend went from bad to worse on Monday when one of the team's trucks crashed in Hungary while heading to Budapest for the next round of the Formula One championship.
Renault said the driver had escaped serious injury but was taken to hospital after the articulated vehicle went off the motorway near Gyor.
The team gave no details about the contents of the truck, one of many used for the European races. Germany and Hungary are back-to-back races with equipment transported directly from one to the other.
Renault had a weekend to forget at Hockenheim, failing to score any points and dropping from fifth to sixth in the standings.
Australian Daniel Ricciardo retired early with an exhaust problem while German Nico Hulkenberg, who had been as high as second, crashed out in the closing stages.
"I'm just gutted, for myself and the team that we couldn't make it stick," Hulkenberg said after the race. "It hurts and it's going to hurt even more tomorrow."
