LOS ANGELES: The U.S. women's soccer team cruised to a 3-0 win over Ireland in Pasadena on Saturday in their first match on home soil since claiming back-to-back World Cup titles in France last month.
The team's "Victory Tour" got off to a winning start when Christen Press sent a high-arcing pass to Tobin Heath, whose header found the back of the net in the 16th minute.
Lindsey Horan doubled the advantage 15 minutes later and Carli Lloyd scored through a header from distance before the break to put the game out of Ireland's reach.
The U.S. are still riding high after defeating the Netherlands 2-0 last month to claim their fourth World Cup title and said their match at the Rose Bowl, where the team won their second world title 20 years ago, was special.
"This is such a historic place and it has such memories for the U.S. Women's National Team," said defender Becky Sauerbrunn.
"We're just so thankful to get to celebrate with everyone who supported us in France.
"This is a great night."
