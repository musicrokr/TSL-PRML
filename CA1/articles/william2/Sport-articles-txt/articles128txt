BARCELONA: Barcelona's substitute goalkeeper Neto has been ruled out of action for up to two months following wrist surgery, the La Liga champions said in a statement on Tuesday.
Barca said the Brazilian, a 26-million-euro (Â£24.15 million) close season recruit from Valencia, would be sidelined for between six and eight weeks after undergoing surgery to treat a fracture to his left wrist which he sustained in training on Sunday.
Ernesto Valverde's side begin their title defence away to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.
