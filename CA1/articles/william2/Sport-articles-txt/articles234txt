BERLIN: Germany keeper Kevin Trapp completed his return to Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday after making his loan move from Paris St Germain permanent with a deal to 2024, the Bundesliga club said.
Trapp played 45 matches in all competitions for Eintracht last season, on loan from the French champions.
He had previously played for Eintracht between 2012 and 2015.
"My time in Paris was amazing, successful and great experience," Trapp said in a club statement. "Now I am fully back home again and want to achieve a lot with Eintracht."
The 29-year-old has also earned three caps with Germany.
Eintracht finished seventh last season and are competing in the Europa League qualifying rounds.
