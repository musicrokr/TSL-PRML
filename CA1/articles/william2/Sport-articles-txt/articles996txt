SAO PAULO: Fluminense snapped a seven-game Serie A winless streak when two second half goals gave them a 2-1 victory over Internacional in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday.
Yony Gonzalez put Fluminense ahead with a close-range header 12 minutes in the second half and Inter left back Natanael doubled their lead when he deflected a shot past his own keeper.
Edenilson pulled one back in stoppage time for Inter, who remain in sixth place in Serie A.
Fluminense moved up a place to 16th in the 20-team table, although they could drop back into the relegation zone if results in Sunday's games go against them.
