HOCKENHEIM, Germany: Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel will start his home German Grand Prix at the back of the grid after failing to set a time in qualifying on Saturday.
Ferrari said the four-times Formula One world champion's car had suffered a turbo-related problem.
Vettel, who started last year's race on pole position but crashed out while leading, has not won a race since the Belgian Grand Prix last August.
The German reported a loss of power on the radio shortly after he left the pits for his first run during the opening phase of qualifying.
