RIO DE JANEIRO: Flamengo came from behind to beat city rivals Botafogo 3-2 in a fiery contest in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday.
Botafogo took the lead in the 13th minute when Cicero scored from a corner but Gerson equalised for Flamengo 11 minutes before halftime.
Gabriel Barbosa put the home side 2-1 ahead eight minutes into the second half only for Diego Souza to draw Botafogo level 13 minutes later.
Yet Bruno Henrique finished off a nice team move from two metres out to give Flamengo - who had five men yellow carded - all three points, as they finished the week in third place in the Serie A table.
Santos went top of the league after beating Avai 3-1.
