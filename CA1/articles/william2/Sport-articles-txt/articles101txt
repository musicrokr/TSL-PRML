REUTERS: Norwich City midfielder Onel Hernandez faces a minimum of three months out after falling on his knee at home and suffering a lateral meniscus tear, manager Daniel Farke said on Friday.
Farke said the 26-year-old could face a longer spell on the sidelines if he has damaged his anterior cruciate ligament and described the situation as a "huge blow" ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash against Newcastle United.
"He slipped over at home and fell on his knee. We have to check if there's something wrong with his ACL. He is out for three months, may need surgery," Farke told reporters.
"Onel is unpredictable and it's a huge blow. He would have been important for tomorrow and for the next few months.
"We can't replace him so we have to find solutions in a different way. It's a big chance for some other players."
Striker Josip Drmic (hamstring) will also miss the clash at Carrow Road while midfielder Kenny McLean (back) is doubtful.
Norwich are already without long-term absentees Christoph Zimmermann and Timm Klose due to knee injuries.
Centre back Zimmermann suffered a setback during rehab and is still a few weeks away from a return, leaving Farke ruing his bad luck.
"We need a bit of luck in terms of injury. You can't complain when something happens on the pitch," Farke added.
"We're unbelievably unlucky because Zimbo and Onel have injured themselves off the pitch. You can't do much about these setbacks."
Norwich were beaten 4-1 by Liverpool in their opener.
