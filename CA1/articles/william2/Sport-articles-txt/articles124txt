PARIS: Moto 2 championship leader Alex Marquez has delayed his projected move into MotoGP by signing a new deal to race for Marc VDS in 2020, the Belgian team announced on Tuesday (Aug 13).
The new one-year deal puts on hold the prospect of the 23-year-old going wheel to wheel with his older brother, five-time MotoGP champion Marc Marquez.
"I am very happy to be able to announce that next season I will continue with Marc VDS in the Moto2 category," said Alex Marquez in a statement on the team website.
"I am very grateful for the confidence of the team."
"With its renewed technical structure, a key part of the current success, I will be able to continue for one more year to improve as a rider, raise my riding level and prepare myself to fulfil my dream of making the leap to MotoGP."
Marquez has won five races this season and leads the Moto 2 standings by 43 points with eight races remaining.
He was Moto 3 champion in 2014.
His brother has a 58-point lead in the MotoGP standings.
