LONDON: England pace bowler Jofra Archer has been omitted from the side for the first Ashes test against Australia starting at Edgbaston on Thursday after failing to recover from injury.
Barbados-born Archer, who made a huge impact in England's triumphant World Cup campaign, taking 20 wickets, has been suffering with a side strain and missed last week's one-off test match against Ireland at Lord's.
Fellow paceman Olly Stone also misses out as does Sam Curran from the original 14-man squad.
Jos Buttler and all-rounder Ben Stokes return for England, who struggled against Ireland, as does 37-year-old record test wicket taker James Anderson after recovering from a calf strain.
Chris Woakes, who took six wickets in Ireland's second innings as they were bowled out for 38, keeps his place.
Team: Rory Burns, Jason Roy, Joe Root (c), Joe Denly, Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, James Anderson.
