SAO PAULO: Brazilian police said on Tuesday they had recommended that rape charges not be filed against soccer star Neymar, after a woman he met online said he flew her to Paris and assaulted her in a hotel there.
Neymar denied the accusations and as part of his public response he released private chats and lurid photos they had exchanged. That led to a separate police inquiry into whether he had committed a crime by posting the intimate pictures online.
