REUTERS: South African Ashleigh Buhai took the first-round lead at the Women's British Open on Thursday as South Korea's Ko Jin-young started well in a quest to win back-to-back majors.
Buhai notched eight birdies in a seven-under-par 65 at Woburn in Milton Keynes.
She headed American Danielle Kang and Japan's Shibuno Hinako by one stroke, while local favourite Charley Hull was among a group two behind.
Four days after winning the Evian Championship in France, Ko continued her sizzling form with an eventful 68.
The South Korean double-bogeyed the 14th hole, three-putting from three feet but while that setback might have demoralised some players, Ko is made of sterner stuff.
She bounced back by hitting the cup with her approach shots at the par-five 15th and par-four 18th for what would have been a couple of most unlikely eagles.
Though neither fell in, she converted the birdie putts.
World number one Ko is seeking her third major title of the year after the Evian and ANA Inspiration in California in April.
There are five designated majors in the women's game.
