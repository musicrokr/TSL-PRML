SYDNEY: Loose forward David Pocock returned to the Australia squad for next week's test against New Zealand on Friday after missing most of the season through injury in a major boost for the Wallabies ahead of the World Cup.
The 31-year-old openside flanker has been sidelined by a calf injury since March 8 and was forced to skip almost the entire Super Rugby season as well as Australia's first two tests of the Rugby Championship against South Africa and Argentina.
The Wallabies play their final match in the competition against New Zealand on Aug. 10 in Perth with a return Bledisloe Cup test against the world champions in Auckland the following week.
Pocock is hoping to play in a third World Cup in Japan later this year after being one of Australia's best players in their run to the semi-finals in 2011 and the final four years later in England.
