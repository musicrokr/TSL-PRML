LONDON: Germany's Mohammed 'Mo Auba' Harkous claimed the US$250,000 first prize as he beat defending champion Mosaad 'Msdossary' Aldossary to win the FIFA eWorld Cup Grand Final on Sunday.
Harkous, one of the most experienced players of the EA Sports simulation in the tournament but not one of the favourites, won 3-2 over two legs at London's O2 Arena.
The first leg, played on the Xbox format ended 1-1 but Harkous edged the PlayStation leg 2-1.
Millions of players around the world had started off hoping to reach the London finals where the top-32 have been in action since Friday - the 58 hours of action streamed live in six languages across social media and leading broadcasters.
Harkous, a professional gamer for Werder Bremen, paraded around the stage holding aloft a German flag.
"I just hope I don't wake up," he said minutes after putting down his joystick. "It's crazy. I didn't expect this and it's unbelievable. "I came here without practising much because it's the end of the season. But I beat Msdossary so it's crazy.
"I don't think I'm that good. You need to have luck and to be in great form," he added before receiving his award from Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha.
Harkous was Germany's first champion of the tournament that began in 2004. "He deserved the win," Saudi Arabia's Aldossary said. "I'll be back next year."
