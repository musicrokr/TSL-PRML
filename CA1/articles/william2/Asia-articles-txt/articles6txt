CHANGCHUN, China: An operating malfunction caused the wave machine at a water park in China's Jilin province to create enormous waves, injuring 44 people.
The accident at the Yulongshuiyun Water Park in the city of Longjing happened at around 2.40pm on Monday (Jul 29), Xinhua news agency reported the municipal publicity department as saying.
Videos on social media show the moment the wave struck the crowded wave pool. The force of the wave was enough to carry some swimmers out of the pool.
As of Tuesday afternoon, 39 people have been discharged, while the other patients remained under observation due to rib or foot fractures.
Operations at the wave pool have since been suspended. The water park opened to the public in 2015, with around 500,000 tourists visiting each year.
