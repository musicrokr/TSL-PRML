The building sitting on 258.3 sqm of land in Gangnam was bought on Apr 3 by the company Boram Family, which runs her YouTube channels, Maeil Business Newspaper first reported.
The news has revived past accusations that Boram was abused by her parents, the Korea Herald reported.
In September 2017, a children's charity pressed charges against Boram’s guardians for "gaining financial profit by putting the children in situations that could put them under mental distress and distributing the footage to the public, with a negatively influence on underage viewers who watch the clips", said the Herald.

The Seoul Family Court upheld the charity’s accusations.
