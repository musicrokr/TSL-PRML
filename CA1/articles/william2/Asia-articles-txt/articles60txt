KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian King Abdullah Riâ€™ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah on Monday (Aug 5) stopped his motorcade on a street near the State Palace in Kuala Lumpur to check on a car accident victim.
This is the 
 that the king has offered his help to victims of car accidents.
A 53-second video posted by the State Palace on Instagram shows the king approach a woman whose car had been involved in an accident along Jalan Susur.
After checking on her condition, Sultan Abdullah continued on his way to the Royal Museum to open an exhibition.
Kuala Lumpur police deputy traffic chief Sarifudin Mohd Salleh confirmed that a Toyota Vios driven by the woman had been involved in an accident at about 9am on Monday.
She is believed to have lost control of the car before it crashed, he told Bernama.
Sultan Abdullah in June pulled over to offer help to another accident victim while on his way to a pre-Cabinet meeting in Putrajaya.
Pictures of the incident had gone viral on social media.
Sultan Abdullah, 60, 
 in January after Sultan Muhammad V from Kelantan stepped down after just two years - a first in the country's history.
