The rallies that began in opposition to a Bill allowing extraditions to mainland China have morphed into a broader bid to reverse a slide in democratic freedoms.
Researchers from four of the city's universities surveyed participants across 12 protests – including mass rallies and "fluid" and "static" demonstrations – between Jun 9 and Aug 4 and found 54 per cent were male and 46 per cent were female.
Overall, 77 per cent of the 6,688 respondents said they had a tertiary education, with 21 per cent saying they had a secondary school education.
The 20-29 age bracket was the most represented with 49 per cent, compared to 11 per cent under 20 years old and 19 per cent aged between 30 and 39. Sixteen per cent were 40 and above.
Exactly half considered themselves to be middle class, while 41 per cent said they were "grassroots".
When asked why they were demonstrating, 87 per cent said they wanted the extradition Bill to be withdrawn, 95 per cent expressed dissatisfaction with police's handling of the protests and 92 per cent called for the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry.
The survey, called Onsite Survey Findings in Hong Kong's Anti-Extradition Bill Protests, was published on Monday and led by researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Lingnan University, the Hang Seng University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Baptist University.
