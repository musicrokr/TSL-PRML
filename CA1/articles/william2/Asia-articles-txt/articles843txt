HONG KONG: Officials from China's State Council will hold a second press conference in as many weeks on the unrest in Hong Kong, as the city's political crisis drags into a third month.
Two representatives from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council - a prominent party organ that deals with the two semi-autonomous hubs - will speak to the media on Tuesday (Aug 6) in Beijing about the "current situation in Hong Kong".

The past fortnight has seen a surge in violence on both sides of the protests, with police repeatedly firing rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse increasingly hostile projectile-throwing crowds.
