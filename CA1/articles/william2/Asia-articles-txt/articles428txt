"In recent weeks, several large-scale protests have taken place at multiple venues in Hong Kong. Although mostly peaceful and orderly, cases of localised clashes following these protests were reported," said MFA.
"Protests which are meant to be peaceful may still have the potential to turn violent with little or no notice."
Singaporeans currently in Hong Kong are advised to stay vigilant and take all necessary precautions to ensure their personal activity, MFA added. 
These include monitoring developments through the local news, heeding the instructions of local authorities and following the Hong Kong Police Force on their social media accounts for the latest updates.
They should avoid protests and large public gatherings and to stay in touch with friends and family, MFA said.
Singaporeans in Hong Kong are also encouraged to
