SHANGHAI: Eighteen people are dead and 14 others missing in a landslide after Typhoon Lekima hit eastern China, state media reported Saturday (Aug 10).
The landslide occurred in the municipality of Wenzhou, which was in the path of the storm as it made landfall overnight, CCTV said.
Super Typhoon Lekima, which slammed into southeastern China early Saturday, brought torrential rain and heavy winds that knocked out power, downed thousands of trees and forced more than one million people from their homes.
The monster storm made landfall in the early hours in Wenling City packing winds of 187kmh, and was expected to churn up the east coast towards Shanghai, Xinhua news agency said.
More heavy rain was forecast for the Shanghai area as well as the eastern provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with authorities warning of possible flash floods, mudslides and landslides caused by the downpours.
In Zhejiang province alone, nearly 300 flights were cancelled, and ferry and rail services were suspended as a precaution.
More than a quarter of a million people were relocated in Shanghai, where the high-speed maglev train that links the city to one of its airports was suspended.
More than 110,000 people were housed in shelters.
China issued a red alert as the storm approached on Friday, before downgrading the level to orange as winds eased on Saturday morning.
The storm had earlier swept past the northern tip of Taiwan on Friday, where nine people were injured, thousands of homes lost power temporarily and more than 500 flights were cancelled.
