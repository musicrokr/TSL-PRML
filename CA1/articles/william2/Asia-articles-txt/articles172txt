KUALA LUMPUR: The Sultan of Pahang, Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah, was installed as the 16th king of Malaysia on Tuesday (Jul 30) in a ceremony steeped in Malay royal customs and traditions, formally marking his five-year reign as the head of state.
Sultan Abdullah, who turned 60 on the same day, was clad in the official ceremonial dress named the Muskat – a long black robe adorned with golden embroidery.
His consort Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah, meanwhile, was dressed in an ivory white attire and matching scarf.
In his maiden address at Istana Negara, Sultan Abdullah called on the people to refrain from inciting misunderstanding by raising matters that can undermine and destroy harmony in the country.
He stressed that unity and harmony are the pillars and strength of the nation. "Playing with fire will burn not only oneself but also the whole village," he said.
The king also pledged to do his best to promote unity and tolerance among people of all races and religions.
"I will put the people first; respect the old and honour the young. I will carry this out with great humility,” he said.
Around 700 guests, comprising the Malay rulers, Cabinet ministers and foreign dignitaries attended the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
Among the notable foreign guests included Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed Zayed Al-Nahyan and Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.
Sultan Abdullah was proclaimed the sixth Sultan of Pahang on Jan 15, succeeding his father. He was subsequently elected as the 16th king at a special meeting of the Conference of Rulers on Jan 24 and was 
 on Jan 31.
His coronation came after the 
 of Kelantan’s Sultan Muhammad V in January.
