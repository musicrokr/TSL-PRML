BANGKOK: China's top diplomat Wang Yi said maritime problems involving Vietnam should not interfere with bilateral relations, according to a report released by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Tensions between Vietnam and China have risen over a weeks-long standoff between ships near an offshore oil block in the South China Sea.
China released the statement following a meeting between Wang and Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh on Thursday (Aug 1) in Bangkok. Wang said China-Vietnam relations continued to develop and the two sides will "properly control and manage the situation at sea."
