KUALA LUMPUR: Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) president Anwar Ibrahim has dismissed speculation that his deputy Azmin Ali is planning to quit the party.
"I did not hear anything about this," said Anwar on Friday (Jul 26). "I only heard about it from the media, but as said before, it’s not true."

Azmin has not commented on speculation that he is leaving PKR.
