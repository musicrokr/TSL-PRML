TEL AVIV: Israeli software company Lightricks, the creator of several photo and video editing apps, said on Wednesday it has raised US$135 million in financing at a US$1 billion valuation.
The round was led by Goldman Sachs Private Capital Investing with participation from additional investors including New York-based Insight Partners and Israel's ClalTech. The latest financing brings Lightricks’ total funding to date to US$205 million. 
Lightricks' seven apps have over 180 million downloads and nearly 3 million paying subscribers. It said it has tripled revenue annually over the past three years. 
The investment will be used to accelerate development of more artificial intelligence-enhanced tools, by making strategic acquisitions and expanding the company’s offices. Lightricks aims to significantly grow its team of 250 across Israel and the UK and open a third office in Germany.
