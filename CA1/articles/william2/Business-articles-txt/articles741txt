REUTERS: Wall Street's main indexes opened below their record highs on Monday, in a muted start to a week likely to be dominated by the Federal Reserve's policy stance and a round of tech company earnings that will again test the impact of trade concerns on global growth.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.21 points at the open to 27,192.24.    The S&P 500  opened lower by 1.39 points, or 0.05per cent, at 3,024.47. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 5.11 points, or 0.06per cent, to 8,325.10 at the opening bell.
