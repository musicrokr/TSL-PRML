PARIS: French carmaker Renault  on Friday cut its 2019 revenue outlook, on the back of falling demand and tough conditions within the automotive industry.
Renault said it was now expecting 2019 revenue to be close to last year's level, down from its previous full-year revenue guidance.
The global auto industry has been hit by China's slowing economy and a trade dispute between Beijing and Washington.
Earlier this week, Renault's partner Nissan  unveiled its biggest restructuring plan in a decade, while Aston Martin  cut its 2019 volumes forecast.
