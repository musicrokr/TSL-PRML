TOKYO: Japan's Toshiba Corp reported on Wednesday a 10-fold jump in first-quarter operating profit as it stepped up cost cuts across divisions, but the profit missed analyst estimates.
The Japanese conglomerate posted an operating profit of 7.8 billion yen (US$73.49 million) for the April-June quarter, up from 730 million yen a year earlier.
The result compared with the 11.63 billion yen average of 3 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Toshiba maintained its annual profit forecast at 140 billion yen. It was in line with the target Toshiba set in its five-year plan.
