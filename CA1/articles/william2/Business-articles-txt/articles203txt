REUTERS: Wall Street's three main indexes rose more than 1per cent on Friday, clawing back some losses from a brutal selloff this week on hopes of more stimulus from central banks to perk up slowing growth.
Stocks got a boost after a report that Germany's government would be prepared to ditch its balanced budget rule and take on new debt to counter a possible recession.
"Germany is now telling us that we are going to have to move forward and spend at a deficit in an effort to keep our economy and the broader economy afloat," said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone Financial Inc in New York.
Earlier, China's state planner said it would roll out a plan to boost disposable income this year and in 2020 to spur consumption as the economy slows.
