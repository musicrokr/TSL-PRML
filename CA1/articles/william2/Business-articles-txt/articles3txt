NEW YORK: Wells Fargo & Co  said on Friday that it boosted its estimate for a possible legal reserve shortfall to US$3.9 billion for the quarter ending June 30, from US$3.1 billion earlier this year, according to a regulatory filing.
The bank said that the increase was due to "a variety of matters, including retail sales practices matters."
