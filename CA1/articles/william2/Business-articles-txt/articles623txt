MILAN/PARIS: PSA's shares  briefly rose as much as 6.6per cent on Wednesday and trading volumes spiked after a Bloomberg report said Dongfeng Motor Corp  is exploring options for its 2.2 billion-euro (US$2.5 billion) stake in the French carmaker.
The report, which was cited by traders as the reason for the brief jump in PSA's shares, said a full or partial sale was being considered.
PSA "does not comment on rumors", the company said in a statement sent to Reuters.
The French carmaker's board has not received any notification or signal that Dongfeng planned to reduce its stake, a source close to the company said.
The surge in PSA's shares was short-lived.
By 1205 GMT, the stock was up just 0.6 per cent at 20.08 euros, lagging the benchmark Paris CAC-40  equity index which was up by around 1per cent.
