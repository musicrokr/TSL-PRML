NEW YORK: US stocks forged higher on Thursday (Aug 8) as tech shares advanced and Treasury yields continued to recover from this week's trade war scare.
The gains for the day drove the broad-based S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq indices back in to positive territory after several wild days.

US equities have yo-yoed this month, battered by disappointment with the Federal Reserve, frightening economic data out of Europe, falling Treasury yields and a sudden deterioration in the US-China trade war.
But yields on the 10-year US Treasury were up 0.02 percentage point at around 1.72 per cent, a day after touching three-year low.
