REUTERS: Sprint Corp  on Friday reported fewer-than-expected losses in quarterly net phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, as the U.S. wireless carrier's cheaper plans helped it retain customers amid its pending merger with larger rival T-Mobile US .
The company said it lost a net 128,000 phone subscribers during the first quarter. Analysts were expecting a net loss of 150,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.
This helped the company post a smaller-than-expected loss and beat Wall Street estimates for revenue, sending its shares up 2.4per cent in trading before the bell.
"... the business still faces several structural headwinds and I remain convinced the merger with T-Mobile is the best outcome for our customers, employees, industry and all stakeholders," Sprint Chief Executive Officer Michel Combes said.
Sprint and T-Mobile, the No. 4 and No. 3 U.S. wireless carriers respectively, behind AT&T  and Verizon Communications  are in the process of merging with each other.
Sprint's earnings announcement comes about a week after the U.S. Justice Department approved its US$26 billion merger with T-Mobile.
As part of that approval, T-Mobile agreed to divest Sprint's prepaid businesses including Boost Mobile and other assets to Dish Network Corp  to build out a viable fourth carrier in a couple of years.
Sprint reported a net loss attributable to the company of US$111 million, or 3 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a net income of US$176 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts were expecting a loss of 4 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total net operating revenue rose to US$8.14 billion from US$8.13 billion, above estimates of US$8.06 billion.
