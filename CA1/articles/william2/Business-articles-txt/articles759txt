LONDON: European and US stock markets were slightly stronger on Wednesday (Jul 31) before a US Federal Reserve interest rate decision, as investors took account of slowing eurozone growth and a batch of company results.
Traders forecast the Fed would deliver its first rate cut in 10 years later in the day, despite data pointing to strong consumer confidence and rising home sales.
"The US central bank (is) expected to cut rates for the first time in a decade, but given the high expectations amongst market participants there is plenty of scope to disappoint," said XTB analyst David Cheetham.
The British pound regained composure against the euro and dollar, having plumbed two-year lows this week on heightened no-deal Brexit fears.

Frankfurt added 0.3 per cent while Paris gained a mere 0.1 per cent as official data showed that eurozone economic growth slowed to 0.2 per cent in the second quarter, down from 0.4 per cent in the previous three months.

Expectations began low and took a further hit after US President Donald Trump launched an attack on Beijing's negotiators which also rocked Wall Street traders on Tuesday.
"My team is negotiating with them now, but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit," Trump tweeted.
In other signs of fallout from the trade row, China reported a third straight month of contraction in manufacturing, despite efforts to shore up the sector.
