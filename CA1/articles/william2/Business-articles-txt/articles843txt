LONDON: Global financial markets have been jolted in recent days by yet another escalation in a trade war between the United States and China, with the resulting selloff and bid for safety pushing assets and markers into new territory for the year.
The following graphics illustrate the key milestones and levels breached over the past few days:
1) VOLATILITY SPIKES
The VIX volatility index , also known as Wall Street's "fear gauge", marked its biggest one-day spike since October 2018 on Monday, as markets foresaw an extended period of price swings for stocks.

4) YIELD CURVE INVERSION DEEPENS
The inversion of the U.S. 3-month to 10-year yield curve deepened further to around -30 basis points, its most negative since 2007 on Monday. The inversion of yield curve is widely seen as a reliable predictor of impending economic slowdowns.

5) CHINESE YUAN BREACHES KEY LEVEL
The Chinese yuan  fell below the key psychological level of 7 yuan to the dollar for the first time in 11 years on Monday as Chinese authorities allowed the currency to depreciate in the wake of the fresh round of U.S. tariffs.
