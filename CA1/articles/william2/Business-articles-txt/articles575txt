REUTERS: Bank of America Corp  said on Monday it would end its joint venture with First Data Corp next June, hours after Fiserv Inc  completed its acquisition of the payment processor.
The bank said it expects to incur a non-cash, pretax impairment charge of about US$1.7 billion to US$2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2019 due to the termination of the partnership started in 2009 to offer electronic payment services to merchants.
