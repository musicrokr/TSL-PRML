REUTERS: Crippled California power company PG&E Corp reported a rise in quarterly losses on Friday and forecast more costs related to the 2017 and 2018 wildfires that have forced it to file for bankruptcy and seek new public and private financial support.
The company now expects costs for the year of US$3.8 billion to US$4.1 billion after-tax, compared with US$1 billion to US$1.4 billion seen earlier.
The San Francisco-based utility filed for bankruptcy this past January, citing potential liabilities of more than US$30 billion stemming from the wildfires.
The forecast includes about US$1.51 billion to US$1.48 billion in costs for the 2017 Northern California wildfires and US$1.61 billion to US$1.58 billion related to the 2018 Camp Fire blaze.
The Camp Fire wildfire erupted in November of 2018, destroyed nearly 19,000 homes and killed 85 - making it the deadliest single wildfire in California history.
In May, state fire investigators determined that PG&E transmission lines caused the fire.
The company on Friday reported a wider net loss attributable to shareholders of US$2.55 billion or US$4.83 per share in the quarter ended June 30, from US$984 million or US$1.91 per share, a year earlier.
The loss was mainly from a US$3.9 billion pre-tax charge for estimated third-party claims related to the wildfires.
Excluding items, the company reported a profit of US$1.10 per share, beating analysts' estimates of 98 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total operating revenue fell to US$3.94 billion from US$4.23 billion.
