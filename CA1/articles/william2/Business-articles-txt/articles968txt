SAN FRANCISCO: PG&E Corp  said in court papers on Wednesday that it "strongly disagrees" with a suggestion in a Wall Street Journal article that the company knowingly deferred maintenance on equipment that caused California's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's modern history.
PG&E filed the papers to answer to an order by U.S. District  Judge William Alsup demanding the power provider respond to the July 10 article, which reported that PG&E did not upgrade parts of its electrical grid that it was aware could spark wildfires.
"PG&E strongly disagrees with the WSJ Articleâ€™s suggestion that PG&E knew of the specific maintenance conditions that caused the Camp Fire and nonetheless deferred work that would have addressed those conditions," the company said.
San Francisco-based PG&E said the article's implication that delayed planned maintenance that could have averted November's Camp Fire is based on a misunderstanding of that work on a transmission line and tower.
"The purpose of that work was not to identify and fix worn or broken parts, such as the hook on the transmission tower that failed and caused the Camp Fire to ignite," PG&E said.
"Rather, the purpose of that work was to address the clearance between transmission line conductors and from transmission line conductors to the ground," PG&E said.
