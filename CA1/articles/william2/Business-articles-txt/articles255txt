MOSCOW: Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Maxim Akimov on Monday called a draft law on limiting foreign ownership in major Russian information technology companies to 20per cent "destructive".
"The competitiveness of the Russian economy is largely determined by the competitiveness of our companies," Akimov said in a statement. "And this draft bill undermines stability and competitiveness of the companies, giving all tech market players wrong signals."
The draft bill was submitted to the State Duma on Friday. Shares in Yandex, known as Russia's Google, were up 3.6per cent in New York after Akimov's statement.
