FRANKFURT: Prosecutors in Stuttgart, Germany are set to fine Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler between €800 million (US$895 million) and €1 billion for diesel-related violations, German magazine Der Spiegel said in its online edition on Friday.
German motor vehicle authority KBA had discovered cheating software fitted to Mercedes-Benz C-Class and E-Class vehicles and ordered the carmaker to recall 280,000 vehicles, Spiegel said.
A fine of up to €5,000 per vehicle is being considered by the Stuttgart prosecutor, the magazine said.
A spokesman for the prosecutor's office said the investigation was ongoing and would not be concluded before year-end.
Daimler declined to comment while the investigation was under way.
In May 2017, German prosecutors searched Daimler offices as part of a fraud inquiry related to possible manipulation of exhaust gas after-treatment in diesel cars.
Daimler also faces regulatory scrutiny by United States authorities. In February 2016 the US Environmental Protection Agency asked Mercedes-Benz to explain emissions levels in some of its diesel cars.
Prosecutors in Germany have used administrative orders to impose fines on Volkswagen , Audi and Porsche, blaming senior management for oversight lapses which allowed emissions cheating to take place.
In May, Stuttgart prosecutors fined Porsche €535 million and supplier Bosch €90 million, while prosecutors in Braunschweig fined VW €1 billion and Munich prosecutors imposed an €800 million fine against Audi.
