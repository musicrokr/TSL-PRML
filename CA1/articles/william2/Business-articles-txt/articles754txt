MEXICO CITY: Mexico's government will propose adjusting the tax system to address the "realities" of the digital economy and e-commerce when the 2020 budget is presented in September, Finance Ministry official Francisco Arias said on Wednesday.
Arias said that no new taxes will be created and that existing taxes will not be increased, but the government will aim to incorporate more taxpayers.
A senior Mexican lawmaker last week told Reuters he plans to present a bill in Congress to tax purchases on Amazon, Uber and AirBnB and other digital platforms to help fill a multibillion-dollar revenue hole after changes in how state oil company Pemex contributes to government finances.
