REUTERS: U.S. stocks fell at open on Wednesday, as a closely-watched bond market indicator pointed to a renewed risk of recession, undoing gains from the previous session due to a retreat by Washington on its latest tariffs on Chinese goods.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 244.83 points, or 0.93per cent, at the open to 26,035.08, tracking losses on other major global markets as economic numbers from China and Germany also disappointed.
The S&P 500 opened lower by 32.17 points, or 1.10per cent, at 2,894.15. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 139.03 points, or 1.73per cent, to 7,877.33 at the opening bell.
