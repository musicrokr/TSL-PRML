HOUSTON: Occidental Petroleum Corp  plans to quickly complete its US$38 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum  after the latter's Aug. 8 shareholder vote, the company said on Thursday.
The earlier-than-expected closing will give the company a head start to evaluate assets that it plans to sell to pay off debt supporting the acquisition, Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said on Thursday.
Anadarko shareholders are expected to approve a deal that provides a 57per cent premium to its share price the day before it disclosed acquisition talks.
