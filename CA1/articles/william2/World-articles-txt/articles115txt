MOSCOW: Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has filed an official complaint saying he was poisoned on Sunday while in custody, his lawyer Vadim Kobzev said on social media on Thursday (Aug 1).
Navalny was rushed to hospital with what his spokeswoman said was "severe swelling of the face and skin redness". 
He was discharged on Monday and sent back to prison where he is serving a 30-day sentence for urging people to take part in an unauthorised opposition protest.
