PHILADELPHIA: A suspect was taken into custody early on Thursday (Aug 14) after a seven-hour armed standoff at a Philadelphia home in which six police officers were wounded in a barrage of bullets.
The gunman had barricaded himself inside the home as police urged him to surrender. Media reported he was armed with a semi-automatic rifle and several handguns.
Police moved in about five hours into the standoff that began after the gunman opened fire on officers as they served a drugs warrant.
The suspect surrendered, hands held high in the air, local news broadcasts showed after midnight, and was taken into custody, police said.
SWAT teams were still securing the home after midnight, police spokesman Eric Gripp said. All six wounded officers had been released from hospital.

"I told him, 'you gotta surrender man'," Johnson told the news station.
The Philadelphia Inquirer also reported that police allowed Johnson to talk to Hill at the scene with a megaphone and telephone. He also approached the front door.
