REUTERS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday approved Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd's treatment for adult patients with a type of rare, non-cancerous tumor usually affecting joints and limbs.
The label for the treatment, Turalio, includes a boxed warning flagging the risk of serious and potentially fatal liver injury.
Independent experts on an advisory panel to the FDA voted in favor Turalio in May.
