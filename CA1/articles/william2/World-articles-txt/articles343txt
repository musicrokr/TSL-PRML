JERUSALEM: Two Palestinian youths stabbed an Israeli policeman in Jerusalem's Old City on Thursday (Aug 15) and were shot by officers, killing one of them, police said.
Video footage aired on Israeli television and circulating on social media showed two young men approaching a police officer at one of the walled Old City's gates, drawing knifes and stabbing him before his colleagues shoot them multiple times.
The Palestinian health ministry confirmed one of the two Palestinians had been killed. Police said they were both minors but did not give their exact age. The second assailant was taken to hospital, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. The officer was moderately wounded, he said.
On Sunday, Palestinians and Israeli police clashed at a Jerusalem holy site nearby, revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and the Jews Temple Mount.
The area is one of the most sensitive sites in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Peace talks broke down in 2014.
