REUTERS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday it had approved Celgene Corp's treatment, Inrebic, for certain forms of bone marrow cancer.
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co announced its plans to buy Celgene in a cash-and-stock deal in early January to bring together the companies that specialize in oncology and cardiovascular drugs in the largest pharmaceutical industry merger ever.
