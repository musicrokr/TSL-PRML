WASHINGTON/LIMA: US Secretary Wilbur Ross will attend a summit in Lima, Peru to discuss Venezuela on Tuesday (Aug 6), the US Commerce Department said.
US national security adviser John Bolton has also confirmed attendance, two sources in Peru's foreign ministry said on Friday.
The sources asked not to be named ahead of an announcement. A spokesman for Bolton declined to comment.
Peru invited some 100 foreign ministers to the summit and had hoped to include Russia, Cuba, China, Bolivia and Turkey. The idea was to foster dialogue between supporters of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his critics, Peru's foreign minister said when he announced the summit last month.
But Venezuela's allies Russia and Cuba turned down invitations to take part, the sources said. China and Bolivia have not confirmed whether they will attend, they added.
The head of the Inter-American Development Bank, Luis Moreno, and the European Union's representative on Venezuela, Enrique Iglesias, have also confirmed their attendance, the sources added.
