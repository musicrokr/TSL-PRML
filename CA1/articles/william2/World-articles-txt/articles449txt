SOFIA: Bulgarian veterinary authorities said on Tuesday that they would cull 17,000 pigs after detecting an outbreak of African swine fever at a breeding farm in the northeast of the country, the fourth industrial farm hit by the fast-spreading virus.
The outbreak was detected at a farm in the village of Popina, near the Danube town of Silistra. Some 87,000 pigs have already been culled in another three farms in the past 10 days.
