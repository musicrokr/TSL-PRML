WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Sunday (Aug 18) he would keep Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate when he seeks re-election in November 2020.
"I'm very happy with Mike Pence," Trump, who is expected to easily win the Republican nomination for a second term, told reporters before boarding Air Force One in New Jersey.
