WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Thursday (Aug 1) he is considering a quarantine or blockade of Venezuela, as the United States steps up pressure on President Nicolas Maduro to relinquish power.
Asked by a reporter whether he was considering such a measure given the amount of involvement by China and Iran in Venezuela, Trump said: "Yes, I am."
