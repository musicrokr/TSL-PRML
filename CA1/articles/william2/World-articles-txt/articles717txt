LONDON: Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi's brother will go on trial in November following his extradition from Libya for a 2017 attack that killed 22 people, a court ruled on Tuesday (Jul 30).
Hashem Abedi, 22, is accused of buying bomb-making chemicals and making detonator tubes for use in the device, as well as helping to buy a car in which to store components.
He will go on trial at London's Old Bailey central criminal court from Nov 5, judge Nigel Sweeney ruled.
Salman Abedi detonated his device outside an Ariana Grande concert on May 22, 2017, killing young fans and their parents.
His younger brother Hashem Abedi left for Libya before the attack.
He was arrested in Libya days after the bombing but was only extradited back to Britain earlier this month.
Libya has been mired in chaos since the ouster and killing of dictator Moamer Kadhafi in a NATO-backed uprising 2011.
The Abedi family, originally from Libya, had fled to Britain during the dictatorship, but the brothers returned to the country along with their father when the uprising began.
