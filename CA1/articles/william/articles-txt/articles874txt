JOHOR BAHRU: A Singaporean man was decapitated when his BMW motorcycle was involved in a freak accident with a van along Jalan Gelang Patah near Iskandar Puteri on Saturday (Jun 15).
Iskandar Puteri police chief Dzulkhairi Mukhtar on Sunday said the 43-year-old motorcyclist was heading to Ulu Choh from Gelang Patah when he crashed into the Toyota Hiace van driven by a Malaysian man at about 9.30am.

“The high-speed impact of the collision resulted in the victim being decapitated and thrown onto the middle of the road."
The 28-year-old van driver was not injured in the accident.
The victim’s remains were taken to Sultanah Aminah Hospital for a postmortem and the case is being investigated.
