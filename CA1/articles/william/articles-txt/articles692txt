SINGAPORE: The electricity tariff for households will increase in the July to September period to their highest rate in nearly five years.
The increase of 6.4 per cent, or 1.43 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), from the previous quarter is mainly due to the higher cost of natural gas for electricity generation, SP Group said on Saturday (Jun 29).
For households, the electricity tariff will rise from 22.79 to 24.22 cents per kWh, excluding Goods and Services Tax (GST), from Jul 1 to Sep 30. This means that the average monthly electricity bill for families living in four-room Housing Board flats will increase by S$5.20.
This is the highest the electricity tariff has been since the October to December period in 2014, when it was at 25.28 cents per kWh, excluding GST.
SP Group reviews the electricity tariffs quarterly based on guidelines set by the Energy Market Authority, the electricity industry regulator.
Gas provider City Gas also announced on Saturday that it will 
 by 1.6 per cent, or 0.30 cent per kWh, for the July to September period.
The increase is due to higher fuel costs compared with the previous quarter, City Gas said.
