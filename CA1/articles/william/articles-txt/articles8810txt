SINGAPORE: About 600 users in Yishun were on Friday (Jun 14) affected by a disruption to fibre broadband services due to a cable cut.  
Telcos Singtel, M1 and StarHub all posted updates on Facebook alerting customers of the disruption. 
The disruption started at around 5pm and was resolved at 10.45pm, said fibre network operator NetLink Trust. 
"We apologise for the inconvenience caused and will continue to work closely with all relevant parties to support end-users who may still be experiencing service difficulties," it said in a statement about 11pm.
A recovery team was deployed on-site to restore the fibre service, according to an update by the company at 8pm. Services were progressively restored throughout the evening, it added.  
Singtel had said that customers in the vicinity of Yishun Ring Road might have experienced difficulties accessing their fibre broadband, Singtel TV and digital home line services. 
M1 added that some of its customers may also have difficulties accessing fibre and fixed voice services, while StarHub said there were customers in Yishun who may experience issues accessing fibre services. 
Singtel and M1 have updated customers later that evening that all fibre services have been fully restored. 
Starhub said the issue had been rectified and asked customers to restart their modems and routers.
This was the latest in a series of fibre cut incidents to hit residents. 
In May, about 2,000 users in 
 were affected by a disruption to fibre broadband services. A similar incident 
 affected about 10,000 users in the eastern part of Singapore.
