SINGAPORE: The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will conduct a 10-day bilateral exercise that started on Saturday (Jul 27).

This is the fourth edition of Exercise Cooperation, which started in 2009. It exercise underscores the warm and friendly bilateral relations between Singapore and China, said MINDEF.
"Besides bilateral exercises, the two armed forces also interact regularly through high-level exchanges, mutual visits, cross-attendance of courses and port calls," it added.
The opening ceremony of the exercise at Jurong Camp was attended by Brigadier-General Frederick Choo, commander of the 3rd Singapore Division, and Major-General Liu Jia, Deputy Political Commissar of the Southern Theater Command Army.
“Exercise Cooperation is one of the cornerstones of our strong bilateral defence ties and defence relations between our two countries,” said BG Choo at the ceremony.
