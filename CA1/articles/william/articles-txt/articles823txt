SINGAPORE: A fire described as "massive" by eyewitnesses broke out at two shophouses in Geylang on Wednesday night (Jun 19), sending plumes of thick black smoke into the air.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a Facebook post at about 9pm that it was at the scene conducting firefighting operations.
The force confirmed at around 10.45pm that the fire involved the contents of two shophouses at unit numbers 67 and 69 in Lorong 14 Geylang.
It had previously said that the fire was at 35 Lorong 14 Geylang.
"SCDF deployed 12 emergency vehicles and about 70 firefighters to the incident," it said.
"At the height of the operations, three handheld jets and an aerial monitor were utilised to mitigate the fire," it added, saying that the fire was under control.
There were no reported injuries.
An eyewitness, who said he could see the flames from Aljunied, described the fire as "massive".
Another CNA reader said he heard an "explosion" from his apartment in Kallang.
"I heard a loud explosion from my living room and I saw the big fire from my balcony," he said, adding that smoke could still be seen at about 9.40pm.
Videos online showed plumes of thick smoke rising from a building. Sirens could be heard and part of a street was cordoned off.
In an update at about 11.30pm, SCDF wrote in a Facebook post that the fire had been extinguished after "nearly three hours of firefighting operations".
