About 2,700 performers will be involved in the show segment, which will be divided into six acts and a prologue, focusing on a narrative of Singapore’s history from its earliest day to the present.
Each act will also be anchored by renditions of classic NDP 
, such as Stand Up for Singapore, Count on Me Singapore and One People, One Nation, One Singapore.
