SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines' budget offshoot Scoot said on Monday (Jul 29) it would convert six Airbus SE A320neo orders to the larger A321neo model and lease another 10 A321neos to help meet the airline's growth goals.
"The A321neos will inject growth possibilities to our network plans for 2020 and beyond," Scoot CEO Lee Lik Hsin said in a statement.
The single-aisle aircraft will be fitted with 236 seats, 50 more than that of the A320neo.
Deliveries are due to begin in the last quarter of 2020, with the planes to fly routes within six hours of its Singapore base.
"We are pleased that Scoot is adding the A321neo to its fleet," an Airbus spokesman said in a statement.
Scoot, which has 37 A320neo family jets on order, had once planned to take 14 Boeing 737-800s from Singapore Airlines regional arm SilkAir.
Those plans were shelved after the 
 of the 737 MAX jet because SilkAir required the aircraft to replace lost 737 MAX capacity.
Scoot said that it expects the A321neo to be more fuel-efficient and have lower noise, nitrogen oxide emissions. Each plane is also expected to produce 5,000 tonnes less carbon dioxide per year.
