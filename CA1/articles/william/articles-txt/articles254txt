Sushiro, Japan’s top-selling conveyor belt sushi chain, will be making its way to Singapore on Aug 19. The outlet at Tiong Bahru Plaza will be the first in Southeast Asia.
The Singapore branch will offer over 100 varieties of sushi and side menu selections with prices starting from a reasonable S$2.20. Ingredients will be imported directly from Japan with “exclusive and seasonal items” introduced to the menu periodically. 
The brand was founded in 1984 and currently has more than 530 outlets in several territories, including Japan, Korea and Taiwan, selling 1.36 billion plates of sushi annually. It has been the highest earning conveyor belt sushi chain in the industry for eight years.
The group’s product development team comes up with more than 600 new dishes every year, and only 70 get launched after rounds of stringent internal screening.
