       "\"whether you’re buying an hdb resale flat as a first-timer or just looking to “upgrade” now that your first bto has passed the 5 year mark, choosing a resale home can be a daunting affair.\\nunlike the hdb bto route where you basically don’t have a say in anything, now the options are literally endless.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nbut that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend an entire year searching for your dream home. \\n\\n\\nbecause after your 12th or 13th viewing, everything will look the same to you.\\ninstead, you should make a list of as many criteria as possible to narrow down your search. (and no, silly, we don’t mean en bloc potential.) here’s a list of key factors to look at when choosing a resale flat.\\n1. price\\nthe very first thing to consider when hunting for a resale flat is your budget. if your budget is $400,000, that’s going to impact a lot of other factors: location, flat size, age and so on.\\nof course, what counts as “within budget” really varies from person to person. some people want a home that’s roughly the equivalent of the proceeds from their freshly-sold bto, while others don’t mind increasing their home loans.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nread also\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncan you afford a hdb flat when you're 35 and single?\\n\\n\\n\\nbear in mind, though, that you probably don’t want to overstretch yourself as you might have a lot of financial commitments (kids growing up, parents growing old) coming up at this point.\\nand stick to your budget! sure, your property agent might upsell you some luxurious $1 million dbss unit, but is he going to pay the extra $600,000 out of his pocket? yeah, didn’t think so.\\nwhen thinking about your budget, also consider the subsidies available to resale flat buyers. for first-timers, you can get $40,000 or $50,000 in grants, while all hdb resale flat buyers can get a $20,000 grant to live within 4km of their family members.\\nmy partner and i qualified for $70,000 in grants when we started looking for a resale flat last year, and this helped to stretch our budget of $400,000 to $470,000. this boost helped a lot, as it opened up more options in mature estates like ang mo kio and bedok.\\n2. location\\nwhile you don’t get much location options with an hdb bto flat, all of a sudden you will have plenty to choose from when shopping for a resale flat.\\nbefore you get too carried away with your dreams of living in expensive hdb estates like queenstown or tanjong pagar, bear in mind that your budget will seriously impact your location options.\\nfor example, while a $500,000 budget would get you a comfortable 4- or 5-room flat in a suburban estate like bukit panjang, it’d be a lot harder to find options in more central places like kallang or tiong bahru.\\xa0if you die-die must stay in one of these estates, be prepared to settle for a much older 3-room flat.\\nfor those considering taking up hdb’s proximity grant of $20,000 to live within 4km of your parents or married children, that’s a good way to narrow down the options. you can use a search tool like 99.co to search by radius.\\nonce you’ve narrowed down the areas you can afford, it’s time to consider the details.\\xa0\\nfor me, having spent a decade waiting for feeder buses, my one criteria was to find a place within walking distance of an mrt station. i don’t mind a good 20-minute walk, as long as i don’t have to rot at the bus stop.\\nif you’re the type who doesn’t want the sun to mess with your carefully cultivated gothic pallor, look for a place with sheltered walkways; if you drive, it’s a definite plus to be located close to an expressway entrance.\\n3.\\xa0amenities\\nalthough the ubiquity of grabfood\\xa0and redmart\\xa0makes it a lot more convenient to live further than spitting distance of the nearest eatery or supermarket, it’s still nice to have at least a kopitiam, supermarket and atm nearby.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nread also\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhow to prevent your hdb flat from flooding\\n\\n\\n\\napart from the basic amenities listed above, you’ll also want to look for the ones that are more tailored to your lifestyle.\\nobsessed with working out? make sure there’s a gym or sporting complex nearby so you don’t have to drag your sorry ass all the way to tanjong pagar when you feel the urge to lift weights.\\nhave a high-maintenance dog that requires monthly grooming? find a place with a vet, groomer and pet supply store, so you don’t blow all your money on ferrying lil bow wow across the island every time he needs a trim.\\ngot a serious 4d habit? find a unit with a singapore pools downstairs so you can scratch that itch anytime… j/k, actually please consider living as far as possible from it.\\n4. coolness\\nsingapore faces sunny weather almost year round, so unless you enjoy coming back to a free sauna, you’d want to consider units that are naturally cooler.\\nmost of us are familiar with the 2 rules of thumb: “no low floor” and “no west-facing units”.\\ni wouldn’t dismiss all low floor units, but it’s true that higher ones tend to get more wind. that said, the floor isn’t everything — there’s also the matter of how obstructed the unit is. if you have a view of your neighbour’s utility yard or the industrial building next door, that probably translates to poor ventilation.\\xa0\\nusually, good views = good breeze, but if you go too high up and opt for a “penthouse”, it might get too hot since you bear the full brunt of the sun.\\nas for “no west-facing”, this is to avoid getting the afternoon sun shining directly into your flat. even if you’re home only in the evenings, you might find it warm and stuffy (it’s said that concrete walls trap heat).\\nif you get a unit that faces east, on the other hand, you’ll still get some sun in the morning, but there’s the rest of the day for your apartment to cool down.\\nwhen viewing a flat, try to visit in the afternoon so that you can see where the sun shines. make sure there’s no air con on, and open all the windows so you can feel the air flow for yourself. even if the unit ticks all the boxes, you might still feel warm if the windows are facing the wrong way.\\n5. flat size/ specs\\nlike i mentioned, your budget would probably affect the type of flat you can afford. for example,\\xa03-room flats are typically a lot cheaper than 4-room and above in the same estate. so if you absolutely have to live in a certain central estate, you may want to consider a smaller flat.\\nof course, this is only if the living space is feasible for your family. i personally love tiny homes, but even so, it could be a real nightmare to be all up in your spouse and kids’ faces 24/7.\\n3-room hdb flats also usually come with just 1 bathroom, which is doable if you’re a couple, but not so much a family with kids who fight for the loo before school. for 2 bathrooms, you’d usually have to opt for a 4-room flat and above.\\xa0\\nanother thing to note that 4-room and 5-room hdb flats usually have the same number of bedrooms, i.e. 3 bedrooms. so before you pay a premium for a 5-room, bear in mind that it’s not going to translate into more bedrooms for your kids.\\xa0\\xa0most 5-room flats simply have larger bedrooms and a bigger living space compared to their 4-room counterparts.\\xa0\\n6. environment\\nthis is a catch-all word that describes all the non-quantitative things that don’t fit into any one category, but make a difference nonetheless.\\xa0obviously, this is going to be highly personal.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nread also\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmake the most of your 5-room hdb with fresh layout ideas\\n\\n\\n\\nsome people prize the exterior facade of the building, finding it important to have nice landscaping, well-maintained lifts and an eye-pleasing building design.\\nothers, perhaps helicopter parents, care more about the safety of the neighbourhood. cigarette butts on the floor and unsavoury characters sitting on the staircases are a no-no.\\nme, i don’t really care about all that stuff, but it was a major plus that my flat faces a park. it’s quiet and peaceful — i distinctly remember hearing only the sounds of\\xa0chirping birds and rustling trees during the visit. elsewhere in the same block, a unit facing the main road would have been a very different story.\\nwhatever the non-tangibles are, it’s hard to know what you want or don’t want at the start, but you’ll get an idea after a few viewings.\\nnotice that i didn’t include the furnishing and fittings of the place, because it varies from person to person. if you’re not terribly fussy about your living space, it’s a definite plus to find a place that’s reasonably nicely done up so you can move in with minimal or no renovation.\\nhowever, if you want every inch of your home to be bespoke, then it doesn’t even matter if the interior of the flat is in shambles. just be sure you include a budget for the renovation to get rid of the seller’s horrible maroon walls and linkin park poster collection.\\n7. remaining lease\\nit’d be ideal if your resale flat could be your forever home, but nonetheless, it’s good to take note of the remaining lease, just in case you have to sell it one day.\\nhdb flats start with 99 years on the lease when they are first built, so that means freshly mop-ed resale flats would have 94 years left. that’s the absolute longest remaining lease you can get for a resale flat.\\nas they age, though, most resale flats lose value, typically around the 30 to 40 year mark. (just like in real life, huh? ok not funny.)\\xa0\\nthis means that if you buy a flat that’s currently pretty old, you may have to resell it at a loss in the future. to avoid this, you might want to limit your search to flats that have at least about 80 years’ lease left. these newer flats are also more modern, typically requiring less renovation work.\\non the other hand, if you’re aware of the “lease decay” issue, by all means go for an older flat. these are currently quite a bit cheaper than their newer counterparts, so it might be a worthwhile trade-off.\\nthis article was first published in  moneysmart .\\n\""

every inch of your home to be bespoke then it doesnt even matter if the interior of the flat is in shambles just be sure you include a budget for the renovation to get rid of the sellers horrible maroon walls and linkin park poster collection  remaining lease itd be ideal if your resale flat could be your forever home but nonetheless its good to take note of the remaining lease just in case you have to sell it one day hdb flats start with  years on the lease when they are first built so that means freshly moped resale flats would have  years left thats the absolute longest remaining lease you can get for a resale flat as they age though most resale flats lose value typically around the  to  year mark just like in real life huh ok not funny\\xa0 this means that if you buy a flat thats currently pretty old you may have to resell it at a loss in the future to avoid this you might want to limit your search to flats that have at least about  years lease left these newer flats are also more modern typically requiring less renovation work on the other hand if youre aware of the lease decay issue by all means go for an older flat these are currently quite a bit cheaper than their newer counterparts so it might be a worthwhile tradeoff this article was first published in  moneysmart  '"

as far as possible from it  coolness singapore face sunny weather almost year round so unless you enjoy come back to a free sauna youd want to consider units that be naturally cooler most of us be familiar with the  rule of thumb no low floor and no westfacing units i wouldnt dismiss all low floor units but its true that higher ones tend to get more wind that say the floor isnt everything  theres also the matter of how obstruct the unit be if you have a view of your neighbour utility yard or the industrial build next door that probably translate to poor ventilation\\xa0 usually good view  good breeze but if you go too high up and opt for a penthouse it might get too hot since you bear the full brunt of the sun as for no westfacing this be to avoid get the afternoon sun shin

to be all up in your spouse and kid face  room hdb flats also usually come with just  bathroom which be doable if youre a couple but not so much a family with kid who fight for the loo before school for  bathrooms youd usually have to opt for a room flat and above\\xa0 another thing to note that room and room hdb flats usually have the same number of bedrooms ie  bedrooms so before you pay a premium for a room bear in mind that its not go to translate into more bedrooms for your kids\\xa0\\xa0most room flats simply have larger bedrooms and a bigger live space compare to their room
